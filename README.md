## 📄 Abstract  
Contrary to traditional models of climbing robots with rigid spines, our team hypothesized that incorporating an active, flexible spine in a gecko-inspired climbing robot would increase its climbing speed on vertical surfaces, compared to robots equipped with a rigid spine.

To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel active spine mechanism actuated by a stepper motor, synchronized with the robot’s leg movements. Comprehensive climbing tests were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this design.

Results showed that the active spine significantly increased the robot’s climbing speed by extending its step length while maintaining accurate directional control. These findings support our hypothesis and demonstrate the potential of flexible spine integration in bio-inspired climbing robots.
